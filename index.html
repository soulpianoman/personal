    selection and performed concert work on Steinway instruments in major Manhattan
    venues including Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. He worked for many other
    venues including The Oregon Symphony, Aspen Festival of Music, Sarasota Music
    Festival and Chamber Music Northwest. Mulcahey has performed concert work for
    many great pianists including Richard Goode, Marc-Andre Hamelin, Garrick
    Ohlssohn, Stephen Hough and Martha Argerich. He practiced several years in
    the Pacific Northwest servicing and rebuilding pianos for the Steinway Dealer
